# Learning Rust, in progress

There are numerous resources available for studying Rust, and I feel overwhelmed by the amount of material. These include:

- The Rust CLI book
- The Rust Programming book
- The Tokio manual
- Ratatui documentation
- Turso Limbo guides
- Rust algorithms and other topics

It's challenging to maintain focus with so many learning paths.
I'll try my best to make a progress without losing focus.
